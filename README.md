## TODO: 
- Implement tanstack query and optimise backend fetching frequency (in progress)
- Create a clear separation between matched results and unmatched results (potentially remove non matches from UI)
- Find way to hide or remove dynamic navbar render delay (currently 'awaits' a cookies.get call on login) -> Quick Fix = loading screen or setting some global state as cookies feel hacky. 
- Mobile Layouts
- Investigate ways to achieve more efficient than current 0(n log n) time for searching. No issues with such a small dataset but a great practice problem.
